# Salary-Prediction
 here we’ll build a model that attempts to predict whether a given job posting has a salary above or below the median salary value of all jobs scraped. This way, when approaching future job applications, we could focus our efforts on those jobs that are likely to pay a desirable wage.  So, from here, we have several objectives when analyzing our scraped data:  Determine the median salary value of those jobs containing existing salary information. Explore job postings containing salary data to determine those characteristics most associated with above- vs. below-median salaries. (We’ll predominantly use natural language processing during this step.) Build a predictive model evaluating jobs’ salary prospects, and apply this model to those job postings containing no salary information.
